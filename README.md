Seatsurfing is a software which enables your organisation's employees to book seats, desks and rooms.

This repository contains the Backend, which consists of:
* The Server (REST API Backend) written in Go
* User Self-Service Booking Web Interface ("Booking UI"), built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which can be installed on mobile devices
* Admin Web Interface ("Admin UI")
* Common TypeScript files for the two TypeScript/React web frontends

## How to use the Docker image

### Breaking change in version 1.13
Up to version 1.12, the ```backend``` Docker image included all the static web resources for the Booking and Admin interfaces. With version 1.13, we separated the web interfaces from the backend server. You therefore need to start the ```booking-ui``` and ```admin-ui``` Docker images separately. The backend has an integrated HTTP proxy which forwards incoming requests for ```/ui/``` and ```/admin/``` to the corresponding backends. If you prefer to handle request routing with a preceding reverse proxy (such as Traefik or nginx), you can disable proxy functionality by setting the environment variable ```DISABLE_UI_PROXY=1```.

### Start using Docker Compose
```
version: '3.7'

services:
  server:
    image: seatsurfing/backend
    restart: always
    networks:
      sql:
      http:
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      POSTGRES_URL: 'postgres://seatsurfing:DB_PASSWORD@db/seatsurfing?sslmode=disable'
      JWT_SIGNING_KEY: 'some_random_string'
      BOOKING_UI_BACKEND: 'booking-ui:3001'
      ADMIN_UI_BACKEND: 'admin-ui:3000'
      PUBLIC_URL: 'https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com'
      FRONTEND_URL: 'https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com'
  booking-ui:
    image: seatsurfing/booking-ui
    restart: always
    networks:
      http:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: 'https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com'
  admin-ui:
    image: seatsurfing/admin-ui
    restart: always
    networks:
      http:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: 'https://seatsurfing.your-domain.com'
  db:
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    networks:
      sql:
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: DB_PASSWORD
      POSTGRES_USER: seatsurfing
      POSTGRES_DB: seatsurfing

volumes:
  db:

networks:
  sql:
  http:
```

This starts...
* a PostgreSQL database with data stored on Docker volume "db"
* a Seatsurfing Backend instance with port 8080 exposed.
* a Seatsurfing Booking UI instance which is accessible through the Backend instance at: :8080/ui/
* a Seatsurfing Admin UI instance which is accessible through the Backend instance at: :8080/admin/

### Frontend (Admin UI, Booking UI)
| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |

| FRONTEND_URL | string | ```req.url``` | Frontend URL |
| PORT | int | 3000 (Admin UI), 3001 (Booking UI) | The server's HTTP port |
| LISTEN_ADDR | string | | TCP/IP listen address (defaults to NextJS' ```hostname``` setting) |

**Hint**: When running in an IPV6-only Docker/Podman environment with multiple network interfaces bound to the Frontend containers, setting the ```LISTEN_ADDR``` environment variable can be necessary as NextJS binds to only one network interface by default. Set it to ```::``` to bind to any address.
